		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			I am Walter Vides, an engineer focused on reliability, delivery pipelines, and practical
			security. I learn by building systems, writing down tradeoffs, and sharing what worked.
		</p>
		<p>
			This blog is a running notebook of lessons from production work: incidents, automation, and
			small improvements that compound over time.
		</p>
		<h2>What I write about</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Platform and DevOps workflows</li>
			<li>CI/CD and operational quality</li>
			<li>Security baselines for everyday engineering</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>How I use this space</h2>
		<p>
			Most posts are short and implementation-oriented. If a topic turns into a deeper guide, I
			break it into follow-up posts and link them together by tag.
