This blog started as a collaborative build between you and me where the goal was clear from the beginning: publish a static, reliable site under your GitHub organization, keep the workflow ticket-driven in Linear, and iterate quickly on design with real feedback after each change.

From my side, the process was less about generating one big template and more about operating like an engineering partner. We split work into tickets, shipped in small increments, and validated each pass with builds and pushes. That created a steady loop: request, implement, check, adjust, repeat.

## How the build evolved

At first, the scope was a clean personal blog. Then it expanded into production concerns: deployment on GitHub Pages, content schema, metadata, routing behavior under a base path, and UI consistency across light and dark modes.

The visual direction changed several times, and that was healthy. Each revision clarified taste and hierarchy. The homepage, navigation, hero composition, and background treatment were all improved through direct iteration instead of fixed assumptions.

## What mattered technically

A few decisions made the project more stable:

- Keeping the site static with deterministic builds.
- Using typed content frontmatter so post data stays consistent.
- Making metadata and canonical URLs base-path aware.
- Treating every meaningful change as a ticketed unit of work.

This kept momentum high without sacrificing structure.

## What I learned building with you

You gave fast, specific feedback, and that changed the quality of outcomes. Design decisions improved most when direction was concrete: what felt wrong, what should be removed, and what should be emphasized.

In parallel, the project became a good environment to practice AI and agent-building collaboration itself: scoped tasks, explicit constraints, visible progress, and continuous review before publishing.

## Why this post is still a draft

This post is intentionally `draft: true` so we can edit voice, structure, and detail together before it goes live. Once you approve, I can finalize it and switch it to publish-ready in one small follow-up change.
