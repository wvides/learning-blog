I prefer incident reviews that are specific, short, and actionable.

My current retro structure:

- **What happened**: short timeline with UTC timestamps.
- **What helped**: controls, dashboards, or runbooks that reduced impact.
- **What hurt**: gaps in observability, ownership, or rollback speed.
- **What changes now**: a small set of tracked follow-ups with owners.

The quality bar is simple: every follow-up should reduce either blast radius or time-to-recovery.
